    "### Explanation of the Get-MgGroup Query\n",
    "\n",
    "The above PowerShell command demonstrates an alternative approach to retrieving group members using the `Get-MgGroup` cmdlet instead of the dedicated `Get-MgGroupMember` cmdlet we used earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Get-MgGroup -GroupId $group.Id` retrieves the group object by its ID (stored in the `$group.Id` variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `-Expand members` parameter is a crucial part of this command. It uses the OData $expand query parameter to include related entities (in this case, the group members) directly in the response, rather than requiring a separate API call to retrieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Select-Object -ExpandProperty members` extracts just the members collection from the group object. Without this, we would get the entire group object with the members as just one property.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, `Select-Object -ExpandProperty AdditionalProperties` extracts the properties of each member object. In the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, many object properties are stored in the AdditionalProperties property as a generic dictionary. **Note:** When working with generic dictionaries, property names are case-sensitive, so ensure you use the correct casing when accessing specific properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how you can use OData query parameters like $expand directly through the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to optimize your API calls by retrieving related data in a single operation."
